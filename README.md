# Drag and Drop CFF Reader/Editor/Exporter

![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/147705317.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/147705317)

A very basic template of a project on which to implement web-based
 cff validation, viewing, editing, export of the [Citation File Format (CFF)](https://citation-file-format.github.io).

Development started at the [Citation File Format Hack Day â€“ Wednesday 5th September 2018](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2018/2018/05/04/hack-day-wednesday-5th-september-2018/) by [Ana Costa](https://github.com/anacost) and [Matt Walker](https://github.com/mattw200). 

A very initial attempt at a web-based CFF editor where a
user can upload a '.cff' file, the schema file and:

* validate
* view
* edit
* export
